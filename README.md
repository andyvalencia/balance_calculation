# Physics Balance Calculation

- tension_string = float(61.0) 
- object_mass = input(6) #this time we choose 6    #mass of object in kg
- g =  9.8        #gravity constant to 1 d.c
- object_weight = int(rod_mass) * g
- possible angles to choose: 40, 60, 90
- angle_chosen = input (40) #40 degrees
- midpoint_of_object = input(3) #meters
- length_of_object = input(6) #meters

purpose of this project
: this project should work for when you want to test if an object attached to a wall and a string will be in equilibrum, you add the values
and the code will work it out for you

## To do items:
- [ ] Update user options
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Add relay
